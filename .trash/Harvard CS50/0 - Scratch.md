## Representation of information

transistors are tiny switches

### Number systems 
#### Binary
bits – binary digits

0 = off
1 = on

| Number | Binary |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0      | 000    |
| 1      | 001    |
| 2      | 010    |
| 3      | 011    |
| 4      | 100    |
| …      | …      |

| $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 1     | 1     |

$0 \times 2^{2}+2 \times 1^{1}+3 \times 1^{0}=3$

<br>

Most computers use 8 bits (byte) (00000000)
64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1


Capital A = 65 = 01000001
[ASCII Table](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html)
“Capital A = 65 = 01000001”

Unicode is a more extensive version of ascii using 16 bits, sometimes 8 bits, sometimes 32 bits


#### Decimal
decimal system 0 → 9
$1 \times 100 + 2 \times 10 + 1 \times 3 = 123$

| 100 | 10  | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 3   |

which is the same as

| $10^2$ | $10^1$ | $10^0$ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1      | 2      | 3      | 

$1 \times 10^{2}+2 \times 10^{1}+3 \times 10^{0}=123$

### Pixel
indivusla dot of colour - pixel
made up of a R G B value

## Algorithm
Step by step method  for solving something 
sets of instructions

## Pseudocode
Not a coding language, something you use to express in English your idea for an Algorithm

```
Pick up phone book 
Open to middle of phone book 
look at page 
If person is on page 
	Call person
else if person is earlier in books 
	open to middle of lef half of books
	go back to line 3 
Else
	Quit
```

**Functions**:
`pick up` `open` `look at`
**Conditionals**
`If` `Else`

### Events
When something happens (“listern for”)

Boolean Expression
